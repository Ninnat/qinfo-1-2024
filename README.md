## Grading Scheme

- 60% Assignments
- 5% Quizzes
- 15% Oral exam
- 20% Written report

The topic of the written report should be related to the topic in this course at an appropriate level. For example, this could be

- Advanced quantum Shannon theory (QST) such as the "mother" and "father" protocols
- Applications of QST to quantum cryptography
- Quantum resource theories
- Quantum Cramér–Rao bound for optimal parameter estimation
- Quantum state tomography
- No-go theorems in quantum foundations such as the [PBR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pusey%E2%80%93Barrett%E2%80%93Rudolph_theorem) theorem, the [Frauchiger-Renner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner%27s_friend#An_extension_of_the_Wigner's_friend_experiment) theorem, or those related to contextuality
