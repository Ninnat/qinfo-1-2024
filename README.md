## Grading Scheme

### MS level

- 40% Assignments
- 30% Oral exam (September 25?)
- 30% Term paper

### PhD level

- 60% Assignments
- 20% Term paper
- 20% Oral presentation

For the MS level, I want you to make an account on Wikipedia and write (as a private draft) an article on your chosen topic in quantum information theory.

For the PhD level, you should pick a research-level topic or paper that you want to learn, write a term paper and gives a 45-to-60-minute talk based on the term paper.

The term paper will be due in the final weeks.

You should discuss with me about the topic of the report; it should at least relates to a topic covered in this course at an appropriate level. Here are some suggestions to get you started:

- Advanced quantum Shannon theory such as the "mother" and "father" protocols
- Applications of entropy to quantum cryptography
- Quantum resource theories
- Quantum Cramér–Rao bound for optimal parameter estimation
- Quantum state or quantum process learning 
- Area laws for entanglement entropy and classical simulation of 1D quantum systems
- No-go theorems in quantum foundations such as the [PBR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pusey%E2%80%93Barrett%E2%80%93Rudolph_theorem) theorem, the [Frauchiger-Renner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner%27s_friend#An_extension_of_the_Wigner's_friend_experiment) theorem, or those related to contextuality
